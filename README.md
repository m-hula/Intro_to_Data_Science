To run the code seen in this project the following R packages are required: Tidyverse, corrplot.

This code helps analyse the best predictors of a footballers market value in the English Premier League via simple linear regression. In addition, a multi-variate linear regression model of the best predictors was used across the other major football leagues to compare it's performance. 

To run the code I recommend following the scripts that are numbered in the correct order. "looking_at_data_0" can be skipped. The scripts labelled 1 and 2 are inital exploration of the data and creating tidy data sets. The scripts 3-8 are simple linear regression models using the variables seen in their titles. Scripts 9-13 are for running the multi-variate linear regression model across the major football leagues. The final script, 14, is code for creating graphs that compare the different models.
